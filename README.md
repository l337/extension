# One Click Bookmark Extension

Making a one click bookmark for people that have too many tabs open.

Later there should be filters to apply that can determine how to orginize them into respective folders. (Machine Learning algorithms).

This is the start of something great

Day 1) Going through basic example in the docs, getting started on first icon round.

Day 2) Created new icons, created bookmark folders with todays date, got list of all open tabs in current window.
Side notes: Is there a way to create a folder on the root rather than going into "other bookmarks" folder
(might have to leverage the popup.html to display bookmarks rather than putting it in the native bookmark menu).
